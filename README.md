# Sparkify-Project Readme
## Data Science Capstone - Churn Prediction at Sparkify
## Project Definition
### Overview
This project is part of my Data Science Nano-degree at Udacity. In this final project, i will attempt to create a machine learning model, which will be able to predict when users at Sparkify are about to churn.

### Blog
I published a post on Medium to go through the Analysis. Please find the link here

### Problem
The high intensity of this project is because of the large amount of data, all of our data wrangling and model creating has to be done using Apache Spark. This adds another level of abstraction on top of the already well-established process, but it does enable us to work with bigger data than we would otherwise be able to.

#### Packages
PySpark, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlot.pylpot

### Models:
Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosted Trees, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest

### Expected Results
At the end of this project, a model for churn prediction should have been created and evaluated. The model should have been trained and tested on a subset of the 12GB of data, and the final testing should happen on completely separate validation set. An running time and F1-Score will be used to evaluate the performance and feasibility of the model.

### References
For this project, the course material at Udacity has been used for reference. On top of that, the official pySpark documentation has also been used ( https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html )
